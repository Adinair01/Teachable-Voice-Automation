# HANDOFF.md — Session history & current state

**Usage:** New session → user says "Review the handoff" → read HANDOFF.md, log.md (rules), CLAUDE.md (spec), then continue
from "Next steps". At the end of every session/milestone → update this file (state, decisions, next steps) and commit.

## Project
Teachable Voice Automation (Samsung PRISM Gen AI Hackathon, Theme 3). Full spec: CLAUDE.md. Rules: log.md.
Dir: /Users/adityanair/Teachable voice Automation. Owner: Aditya Nair (Node dev, no Android experience).
Deadline: 25 Sep 2026 11:59 PM IST (aiming for 2–3 day build).

## Environment (as of 2026-09-20)
- macOS, node v26, npm 11, Docker 29, JDK 17, git.
- Installed via brew: android-commandlinetools, android-platform-tools (adb), gradle 9.7.
- ANDROID_HOME=/opt/homebrew/share/android-commandlinetools ; SDK platform 35 + build-tools 35.0.0 (34 also present).
  Export ANDROID_HOME and PATH (cmdline-tools/latest/bin) in each shell.
- No Android Studio (CLI-only builds via Gradle). Test device: physical Android phone via USB (not yet connected).
- User has Deepgram + Groq keys; will place in backend/.env himself. Mongo runs in Docker.

## Decisions
- CLI-only Android toolchain; physical phone; phone→backend via `adb reverse tcp:3000 tcp:3000` (settings screen also allows LAN URL).
- Plan compressed to 3 days with gates (CLAUDE.md).

## Log
- 2026-09-20: Wrote CLAUDE.md, .gitignore, git init + first commit. Installed Android CLI toolchain. Created log.md and HANDOFF.md.

## Status
- Day 1 not started (code). Blocked on: phone connected via USB w/ debugging (model, Android version, Auto Blocker off, WhatsApp logged in).

## Next steps
1. Confirm `adb devices` lists the phone.
2. Scaffold Kotlin Android project (Gradle CLI) with AccessibilityService; prove UI-tree read + tap/type/scroll on WhatsApp & Settings; flag empty trees.
3. Backend skeleton in /backend (Express + Mongo + Docker + .env.example) in parallel.
4. Report at Day 1 GATE.

## Open items
- Team name (CollegeName_TeamName) — needed before submission filenames (Day 3).
